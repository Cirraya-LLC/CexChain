# CexChain

**Verifiable records for business, built for the age of AI agents.**

CexChain is a ledger protocol and node for trust between organizations. Every document, asset, and action can be independently verified by anyone, without relying on a platform operator. The action can come from a person or an AI agent.

> **Status:** early development (protocol v0.1). Interfaces and formats may still change.

## Why

- Certificates, invoices, agreements, and quality reports move between companies as scans, stamps, and phone calls. Verifying them is slow, and disputes are hard to settle.
- AI makes forging documents nearly free, and AI agents increasingly act on behalf of companies. Looking genuine no longer proves anything. Cryptographic provenance does.

## Design principles

- **Verifiable, not just "on chain."**
  - Tamper-evident history: a Merkle log with inclusion and consistency proofs.
  - Non-repudiation: every action is signed.
  - Independent verification: any third party can check a record without trusting its issuer's database.
- **Sovereign first.**
  - A single organization gets value on day one.
  - External witnesses co-sign checkpoints, so history can be neither rewritten nor forked.
  - Ledgers federate later.
- **Documents stay off-chain.** The ledger holds salted commitments, signatures, state transitions, grants, and access records. Content is encrypted and stored separately.
- **People and AI agents are first-class actors.**
  - Every action records who acted and under whose delegated authority.
  - Delegated scope can only narrow.
  - Human actions carry proof of presence. An action without it is attributed to a machine.
- **Crypto agility.** These algorithm families can coexist in one ledger, chosen per signature:
  - international algorithms (Ed25519, ECDSA P-256)
  - Chinese national standards (SM2, SM3, SM4)
  - post-quantum algorithms (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA)
- **Standards-aligned.** Deterministic CBOR, COSE, RFC 9162 Merkle trees, IETF SCITT, W3C Verifiable Credentials, MCP, and A2A.
- **Deterministic core.** No floating point, no unordered iteration, and injected time and randomness. This makes deterministic simulation testing possible.

## Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `core` | Deterministic CBOR, COSE, Merkle proofs, protocol objects, ledger rules, and the offline evidence verifier. Portable C++23 that can be built to WebAssembly. |
| `crypto/openssl` | Cryptographic backend: SHA-2, SM3, Ed25519, ESP256, SM2, ML-DSA |
| `ledger` | Ledger node: crash-safe storage, rule engine, checkpoints, receipts, evidence export (C++26) |
| `cli` | `cexchain` command-line tool: full control of keys, ledgers, actors, delegations, records, proofs, and evidence |
| `cexchain mcp` | MCP server through which an AI agent acts under its own key and delegation |

## Quick start

```sh
# Private keys are encrypted (PKCS #8, scrypt + AES-256). Passphrases come from
# a prompt, --passphrase-file, or $CEXCHAIN_PASSPHRASE.
cexchain key generate --out root.key
cexchain key generate --out log.key
export CEXCHAIN_LEDGER=./ledger
cexchain init --org "Example Factory" --root-key root.key --log-key log.key

# Alice generates her own key and sends only its public half.
cexchain key generate --out alice.key && cexchain key public alice.key --out alice.pub

# Register her as an inspector and let her issue certificates.
cexchain actor add --as root.key --kind person --name "Alice" --key alice.pub
cexchain delegation grant --as root.key --to <alice-id> \
    --allow record-register,record-endorse --record-types cexchain.certificate/1 --days 30

# Issue a certificate; field values stay private until disclosed.
cexchain record issue --as alice.key --type cexchain.certificate/1 \
    --field product="Flange DN50" --field result=pass --attach report.pdf
cexchain record history <record-id>

# Checkpoint, export evidence with one field disclosed, and verify it anywhere.
cexchain checkpoint create --log-key log.key
cexchain export <record-id> --log-key log.key --disclose result --with-attachments --out evidence.cbor
cexchain verify evidence.cbor --ledger-id <ledger-id> --attachment report.pdf=report.pdf
```

The verification report shows every event in the record's history, who performed it (person or
AI agent, with the agent's model and accountable person), under whose delegation, which fields
were disclosed, and whether attachments match.

## Command line

The `cexchain` tool controls every part of a ledger:

| Area | Commands |
|---|---|
| Keys | `key generate`, `key show`, `key public`, `key passphrase` |
| Ledger | `init`, `status`, `audit`, `log list`, `log show`, `log export` |
| Actors | `actor add`, `actor list`, `actor show`, `actor revoke`, `actor rotate-key` |
| Delegations | `delegation grant`, `delegation list`, `delegation show`, `delegation revoke` |
| Records | `record issue`, `record list`, `record show`, `record history`, `record fields`, `record endorse`, `record transition`, `record revoke`, `record types` |
| Proofs | `checkpoint create`, `checkpoint list`, `checkpoint show`, `proof inclusion`, `proof consistency`, `receipt` |
| Evidence | `export`, `verify`, `inspect` |
| Vault | `vault status`, `vault keygen`, `vault rekey` |
| AI agents | `mcp` |

- Every command takes `--help`, and `--json` for scripting.
- `cexchain help --json` describes every command and option in machine-readable form.
- `source <(cexchain completion bash)` (or `zsh`) enables tab completion.
- IDs can be shortened to any unique prefix of 8 or more hex digits.
- Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for a usage error, 2 for a failure, and 3 when evidence or a ledger fails verification.

Private field values never sit on disk in the clear. They are sealed with HPKE (RFC 9180: X25519,
HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM) to the ledger's vault key, and each sealed file is bound to its ledger and
record. Anyone who may issue records, AI agents included, can add to the vault, but only holders of
the vault private key can read it. The vault private key can be kept off the ledger host
(`vault keygen`, `init --vault-public-key`) and rotated at any time (`vault rekey`).

## AI agents (MCP)

`cexchain mcp --ledger DIR --as AGENT_KEY` runs a Model Context Protocol server over stdio
(revision 2026-07-28, with fallback to earlier revisions). The agent can look up its identity and
delegations, query and issue records, endorse, move records through their lifecycle, and verify
evidence from others. Every action is signed with the agent's own key, refused by the ledger if
its delegation does not cover it, and recorded with provenance: its model, a hash of the inputs it
acted on, and the digest of the tool it used. Verification reports show all of this. MCP clients
start the server without a terminal, so give it the agent key's passphrase with
`--passphrase-file` or `CEXCHAIN_PASSPHRASE`.

## Building

Requirements:

- GCC 16 (primary) or a recent Clang (tested with Clang 23)
- CMake 3.28+ and Ninja
- OpenSSL 3.5+

```sh
cmake --preset gcc-debug
cmake --build --preset gcc-debug
ctest --preset gcc-debug
```

Other presets: `gcc-release`, `clang-debug`, `clang-asan` (AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer), and `clang-fuzz` (libFuzzer targets).

Fuzz targets cover every parser of untrusted input:

```sh
cmake --preset clang-fuzz && cmake --build --preset clang-fuzz
./build/clang-fuzz/fuzz/cbor_decode_fuzz -max_total_time=300
```

Test vectors in `testvectors/` come from implementations independent of CexChain. `tools/testvectors/generate.py` regenerates them.

On macOS, Homebrew's LLVM is keg-only. To use it with the Clang presets, add a `CMakeUserPresets.json` that inherits a Clang preset and sets `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++`. Homebrew's `openssl@3` is detected automatically.
